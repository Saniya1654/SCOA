    "* **Population diversity**: because only two parents produce the entire next generation, population diversity is low. You could keep some elites and also allow random parents to mate.\n",
    "* **Fitness cost**: `cross_val_score` trains/evaluates a model many times — this is expensive. For small datasets it’s fine; for large data consider fewer folds or other validation strategies.\n",
    "* **Reproducibility**: you might want to seed `random` and `numpy` to make runs reproducible (`random.seed(0)` and `np.random.seed(0)`).\n",
    "* **Hyperparameter ranges**: ranges (1–20, 2–10) are arbitrary; tune them to suit your problem.\n",
