    "# **Fuzzy Set (Short Note)**\n",
    "# - A fuzzy set allows elements to have a degree of membership between 0 and 1.\n",
    "# - Unlike crisp sets (membership = 0 or 1), fuzzy sets handle partial truth.\n",
    "# - Represented using a membership function μ(x).\n",
    "# - Useful when boundaries are vague, e.g., “tall”, “hot”, “fast”.\n",
    "# - Example: A = {(160, 0.2), (170, 0.5), (185, 1.0)} for the fuzzy set “tall people”.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# **Fuzzy Logic (Short Note)**\n",
    "# - Fuzzy logic is a reasoning system that uses fuzzy sets to make decisions under uncertainty.\n",
    "# - Truth values range between 0 and 1 instead of strict True/False.\n",
    "# - Fuzzy operators:\n",
    "#     AND → min\n",
    "#     OR → max\n",
    "#     NOT → 1 - membership\n",
    "# - Used in AC control, washing machines, robotics, medical diagnosis, etc.\n",
    "# - Example: If “temperature is hot” = 0.7, fuzzy logic may increase fan speed proportionally.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# -------------------- RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FUZZY SET & FUZZY LOGIC --------------------\n",
    "#\n",
    "# **1. Fuzzy Logic is built on Fuzzy Set Theory**\n",
    "# - Fuzzy sets provide the mathematical base.\n",
    "# - Fuzzy logic uses fuzzy sets to perform reasoning and decision-making.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# **2. Fuzzy Sets model uncertainty; Fuzzy Logic interprets it**\n",
    "# - Fuzzy sets express uncertainty through partial membership.\n",
    "# - Fuzzy logic uses these values to draw conclusions.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# **3. Fuzzy Set Operations become Fuzzy Logic Operators**\n",
    "# - Union → max  → OR\n",
    "# - Intersection → min  → AND\n",
    "# - Complement → 1 - μ  → NOT\n",
    "#\n",
    "# **4. Fuzzy Sets = Input Representation; Fuzzy Logic = Decision Process**\n",
    "# - Fuzzy sets convert vague terms (“slow”, “young”, “hot”) into numerical membership.\n",
    "# - Fuzzy logic applies rules:\n",
    "#       IF temperature is \"hot\" AND humidity is \"high\" THEN fan_speed = \"high\".\n",
    "#\n",
    "# **5. Combined Use in Real Systems**\n",
    "# - Inputs → converted to fuzzy sets.\n",
    "# - Fuzzy logic rules → process membership values.\n",
    "# - Output → converted back to crisp output.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# **One-line relation summary:**\n",
